1.Characteristics of BigData:
 
Bigdata refers to dealing with large volume of data which cannot be processed using RDBMS.There are 5v's
 which forms the characteristics of bigdata.

Volume:Volume refers to amount or quantity of data.It denote the size of data.Size plays a vital role in
determining value out of data.Although depending upon the volume only the data can be considered 
as bigdata or not.

Variety:Vareity refers to type and nature of data.It can be structured,unstructured or semi-structured.
Previously data will come in the form of spreadsheets and databases and now data comes in the form of
videos,photos,PDFs,emails etc..,

Velocity:Velocity refers to speed of data processing.It deals with how fast the data is generated and processed
to meet the demands and to determine real potential in the data.

Veracity:Veracity refers to noise and abnormality in data.It analyzes whether the data is being stored and

Value:Value includes large volume and variety of data that is easy to access and delivers 
quality analytics.Value is the most important characteristics of bigdata.

2.Possible solutions to handle bigdata:

The possible solutions to handle bigdata are scale up and scale out.
*Scaleup:Scale up increases the configuration of single system.In scale up resources are added
to single system.It is costly,complex and time consuming one.

*Scaleout:In scale out multiple machines are used and loads of storage are distributed among them.
Its is advisable to use scale out because it is more reliable than scale up.

3.Difference between scaling up and scaling down:

*Scalingup:Scaling up increases the configuration of single system.In scale up resources are added
to single system.It is costly,complex and time consuming one.

*Scalingout:In scaling out multiple machines are used and loads of storage are distributed among them.
Its is advisable to use scale out because it is more reliable than scale up.
